# Wack Pack Hangman

Created for a coding bootcamp assignment, uses constructor functions along with [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) and [chalk-pipe](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk-pipe) npm packages to play a version of hangman on the command-line centered around Howard Stern Wack Pack members.

To begin, after running `npm install`, use this command to start:

```
$ node main.js
```
**Hint**: Includes both living and deceased wack pack members, but none that were deemed "not wack pack material" by Howard in 2015.
